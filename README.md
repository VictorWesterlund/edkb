# Elite Dangerous - Multi-purpose keybinds

These binds were created to provide quick access to useful exploration, combat and miscellaneous flight functions based on my personal play style.

**Intended for commanders using HOTAS or DualShock/Xbox controllers;** as WASD are rebinded.

The binds were (sorta carefully, sorta organically) chosen in reference to a cheap wireless keyboard I picked up specifially for this purpose. Key placements might not make as much sense depending on your keyboard.
